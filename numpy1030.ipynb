    "High-level languages are \"slow\" because it takes some extra steps to convert the \"human-readable\" code into \"machine-readable\" code. Something like sqrt(x) is very readable to you and me, but \"sqrt\" requires a lot of hand-holding for the computer execute. And even using the variable \"x\" is not trivial... x is a character symbol that directs the computer to a certain location in memory where data of a certain type is stored, probably a \"float\" or \"double float\" ostensibly with the form $a\\cdot 2^b$. A certain number of bits are devoted to storing the digits in $a$, and a certain are devoted to $b$, and there is a bit for the sign of $a$, and a bit for the sign of $b$, ... there is a lot of interpreting that has to happen! And it has to happen over and over again if we need to take the square root of a list of numbers!"

    "**Why NumPy?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python was not originally designed for numerical computing. If you need to multiply two matrices together in native Python, you need to use a for loop on a list of lists (i.e., the matrix is [[1,3],[5,7]]... a list of lists). Lists are not at all specialized to numbers -- they can contain numbers, or 'strings', or other lists. And so, ostensibly, the computer has to figure out what is going on with the referencing in the loop, what data it is then looking at, how to interpret the data, then it must do whatever operations are necessary, etc. So, not only is the human-readable code not particularly concise (compare to MATLAB: A*B is the matrix product!), the code is not readily \"readable\" by the computer. All this means... slowness.\n",
