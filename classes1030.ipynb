    "In Python (and in a lot of languages, including MATLAB), we can pass variables to functions. It seems intuitive to call variables \"objects\". We can also pass functions to functions. Functions are objects too. These are two different \"classes\" of objects... and actually, variables can be scalars or lists or numpy arrays. Those are different classes, and we can do different things with different classes of objects.\n",

For an object that is part of this class, called, say, u, it would be really neat to have quick access to the following information: \n",
